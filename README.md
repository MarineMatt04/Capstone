# Movie Genres 

# The Question:
All genres of movies draw different crowds, but which genre holds the most appeal to the masses and do these genres fair better during a specific time of year?

# The Data:
This study reviews 5 years, from 2014-2019, of movie releases and their opening weekend gross at the box office. 

# The Benefit:
The information provided from this study will serve as a guide to production studios as to what genres of movies will net their business the most profit and, more specifically, what time of year is best to release such films so as to attract the largest audiences.

# The Details:
Movies have always been a passion of mine, from the actor/director relationships to the utilization of physical sets versus CGI technology. Movies have hundreds of facets that attribute to their success or demise. However, I wanted to take a closer look at the bigger picture of the audience/genre coorelation to divulge the appeal of certain movie types and how they compare with each other. More interesting than the mere popularity of certain genres to others was analyzing whether the film industry utilizes an algorithm for their release of specific movie types to draw a bigger crowd or if the analysis of this data would reveal a pattern for yeilding the best box office returns during a certain time of year. This information serves as a sort of map to the production studios to time the release of their films according to the season in which specific genres gross the most in box office revenue as well as providing an "anticipation platform" for the avid movie-goer of when they can expect their favorit films to be released. 

# Notable Data Analysis Decision:
In my study, I drew new release data from the years 2014-2019. This is due to the fact that COVID-19 had a dramatic affect on box office returns as well as movie releases in general beginning in 2020. This drastic offset in data would have caused a major "misinterpretation" of my analysis and, in fact, poses a whole seperate set of questions to be answered altogher. I would like to use this intial study as a platform to launch further inquisitions on multiple levels into the film industry.
I utilized the "Opening Weekend Gross" value to guage the popularity of films and their respective genres. This number most accurately reflected a movies' success and narrowed it down to a specific time of year. This best provided the necessary information to conclude concise reults for my analysis.
